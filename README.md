Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reaching your fitness objectives might be difficult in today's
fast-paced society.

The FitLife application is a comprehensive wellness solution created to give users the tools they
need to actively manage their fitness and health through the use of a novel daily score system.

In the scoring process, important user parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, weight,
daily steps (derived from gadgets like Fitbit or smartwatches), user adherence to daily

converts them into a daily score. By giving users fast, quantifiable feedback on their daily efforts,
this score system aims to motivate users to adopt healthier lifestyle choices. The desired goal is
